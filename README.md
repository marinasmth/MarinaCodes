My name is Marina Smith
I learn to code from scratch as part of the App Development course at the Creative Computing Institute (UAL).

I studied Fine Art at Central Saint Martins, where my practice focused on sexuality, vulnerability, and power.  
For several years I explored pornography — both as a subject and as a medium — trying to understand what drives people to expose themselves, why vulnerability can feel like connection, and where choice becomes dependence.

Over time my attention shifted from the body to the systems that frame it.  
I became more interested in technology — in the architecture of choice, in how control and care overlap.  
From exploring BDSM and consent, I moved to studying software, where limitation and permission form another kind of choreography.

I am now studying App Development at the Creative Computing Institute (UAL) with Joel Gethin Lewis.  
My current research revolves around **care through limitation** — how design, interfaces, and code can express empathy not through abundance but through structure and boundaries.  
Learning to code is part of that experiment: a way to understand technology from within, as a system of decisions and dependencies.
